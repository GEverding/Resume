<br/>Dear Mr./Ms. Last Name:
<br/>
<br/>I am very interested in employment as a co-op student with {insert company name}.  As a leader in {some facts about company}, I feel that you have the need for a co-op student with strong problem solving skills, an aptitude to learn quickly on the job and someone who is confident working in a group environment. To this end I have enclosed a complete resume outlining my professional qualifications for your review and consideration.
<br/>
<br/>I am in the process in attaining a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Waterloo.  Throughout my university career I have been a part of several design teams, in each instance our design achieved the required goals.  I have a deep desire to learn and apply what I have learned in and out of the classroom to real world problems.
<br/>
<br/>I would be very pleased to have the opportunity to interview with your company at your convenience.  I can be reached by phone at (226) 868-5820 or by email at gseverdi@uwaterloo.ca.  Thank you for your consideration.
